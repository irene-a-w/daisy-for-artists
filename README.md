Daisy for Artists

Daisy is a CRUD web application implemented using the MERN stack that allows users to send comission requests to other users. Users that recieve requests can accept/decline the request and update the status of the request. A user's recieved request will be displayed on their profile and a logged in user can see their sent requests.
